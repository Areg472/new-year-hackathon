#### One small step for Codedex, one giant leap for Areg
# Introducing...
### Areg Travels!
This is my retro-styled website for Armenian travel tours. 
During the 90s it revolutionized the internet by introducing mobile(never seen gadget) optimization, CSS in element classes, 90s mode, and hover/click effects.

## Welcome to the new age!

In this Codedex Hackathon I learned a lot about marketing, did some excellent video editing, saw some good marketers (Val), and had fun with the community!
Thanks a lot to the whole Codedex team for organizing this event!
